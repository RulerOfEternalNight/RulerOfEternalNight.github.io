title: "Unlocking Efficiency in Implicit CoT Reasoning: A Speculative Decoding Approach"
excerpt: "This project introduces a novel speculative decoding technique tailored to enhance the efficiency of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). CoT reasoning enables models to solve complex tasks through sequential reasoning steps, but it is often hindered by high memory demands and inter-token latency during top-k decoding. Our method leverages inherent parallelism in CoT tasks, enabling simultaneous token generation while maintaining high reasoning accuracy. By combining open-source models like Qwen2.5 and Vicuna 7b and conducting experiments on datasets such as GSM8K and StrategyQA, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces computational overhead without compromising performance. This advancement opens new pathways for deploying LLMs in real-world applications requiring efficient and accurate reasoning."
