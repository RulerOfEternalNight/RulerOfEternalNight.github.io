## ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪  Hello!! 

I am Jegadit S Saravanan, a Computer Science and Engineering student at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. I have a keen interest in robotics, machine learning.

I used to be really into cybersecurity, but I've since shifted my focus to develop intelligent and autonomous systems using ML and DL. I am always eager to explore new technologies and concepts. Throughout my academic journey and professional experiences, I've consistently sought opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems, pushing the boundaries and delivering impactful solutions.

I co-founded the [Deep Water Marine Club](https://rulerofeternalnight.github.io/AUV/), where I actively contribute as a Robotics Engineer and ML/DL Researcher, alongside three like-minded friends who shared my passion for merging robotics, machine learning and deep learning for real-world practical applications. We started this student-led club to support our final year project but it soon became a platform for individuals interested in fields such as robotics, computer science, aerospace, and communication systems to connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects.

<!-- If you share my interests or just want to talk, please feel free to reach out to me. :) -->

<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->
