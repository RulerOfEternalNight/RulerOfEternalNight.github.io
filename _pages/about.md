I am Jegadit S Saravanan, an incoming MS CS student at UIC. I did my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Coimbatore. 

I have a keen interest in robotics & machine learning.

I used to be really into cybersecurity, but I've since shifted my focus to intelligent & autonomous systems. I am always eager to explore new technologies & concepts. Throughout my academic journey & professional experiences, I've consistently sought opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world problems, pushing the boundaries & delivering impactful solutions.

I co-founded the [Deep Water Marine Club](https://rulerofeternalnight.github.io/AUV/), where I actively contribute as a Robotics Engineer and ML/DL Researcher, alongside three like-minded friends who shared my passion for merging robotics, ML & DL for real-world practical applications. We started this student-led club to support our final year project but it soon became a platform for individuals interested in fields such as robotics, computer science, aerospace, & communication systems to connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects.

If you share my interests or just want to talk, feel free to reach out to me.

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
